# This is a guide to writing emojis

- Most of the time you can just copy and paste emojis into your markdown file. Many Markdown applications will automatically display the emoji in the Markdown-formatted text.

- You can also use emoji shortcuts that start with a colon and ends with the name of the emoji, like `:joy` that would render :joy
