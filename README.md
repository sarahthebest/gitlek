# This is a guide to inserting images in markdown

To insert a image add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL. 

`![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")`

would render this:

![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")

# This is a guide to highlighting words in markdown

Highlighting text isn't common, but some Markdown processors allow you to highlight text. To highlight words use two equal signs before and after the highlighted text. `==highlighted==` would render this: ==highlighted== 

# This is a guide to inserting a table in markdown

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

`| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |`

would render this:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

# This is a guide to writing emojis in markdown

- Most of the time you can just copy and paste emojis into your markdown file. Many Markdown applications will automatically display the emoji in the Markdown-formatted text.

- You can also use emoji shortcuts that start and end with a colon and ends with the name of the emoji, like `:joy:` that would render :joy:

# This is a guide to making horizontal rulers in markdown

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.
